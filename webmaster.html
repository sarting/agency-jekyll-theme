<br>Pages in homes4u.us were revised in June 2016.
<br>If you wish to comment about the website, or
<br>have questions/problems, please try a different 
<br>browser. It is, what it is. This is what happens
<br>when you use free stuff to build a website. 
<br>
<br>This means I do not have any obligation(s) to
<br>fix what is bothering you, nor do I have the time
<br>to listen to your rants. I had to learn this from
<br>scratch, and was able to figure it out. So if you 
<br>have anything to say about it, good or bad, keep 
<br>it to yourself. However, shout-out to Tyler Gray
<br>for getting me started. <3
